What this program does: An automated game of war. War is usually two-player. Each player starts with an equal number of cards, until the deck is completely divided. In a move, each player places the card at the top of their deck down. The player whose card is a greater number (assuming jack = 11, queen = 12, king = 13, ace = 14, and joker = 15) keeps their card and takes the card of the other player. The game ends when one player has all the cards.

What this program entails: A data file of the integer value of each card in a 54-card deck. Cards are dealt with random methods. Uses list methods to reuse cards and transfer cards from one player to another. Keeps track of the number of moves with a counter variable.

Future applications: The user playing against the computer. Automated version can be extended to play multiple games and calculate the average number of moves per game.
